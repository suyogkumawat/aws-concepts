## Introduction to Auto Scaling

Auto Scaling in AWS is a service that automatically adjusts the number of Amazon EC2 instances in a group to maintain application availability and scale capacity up or down according to demand. This ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and cost efficiency by only running the resources you need.

Auto Scaling consists of three main components:
- **Launch Template/Configuration**: Defines the instance configuration (AMI, instance type, key pair, security groups, etc.).
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: Logical grouping of EC2 instances managed collectively.
- **Scaling Policies**: Rules that determine when and how to scale in or out.

## Launch Configuration Prerequisites

Before creating a launch configuration, ensure you have:
- An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to launch your instances.
- An EC2 key pair for SSH access (if needed).
- Security groups to control network access.
- IAM roles (if instances need AWS permissions).
- (Optional) User data scripts for instance initialization.

## How to Create Launch Configuration

1. Go to the EC2 console.
2. Under "Auto Scaling," select "Launch Configurations" or "Launch Templates" (recommended).
3. Click "Create launch configuration/template."
4. Specify:
   - AMI ID
   - Instance type
   - Key pair
   - Security groups
   - (Optional) IAM role, user data, storage settings
5. Review and create the configuration.

*Note: AWS recommends using Launch Templates, which offer more features and flexibility than Launch Configurations.*

## How to Create Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)

1. In the EC2 console, choose "Auto Scaling Groups."
2. Click "Create Auto Scaling group."
3. Enter a name and select the launch template/configuration.
4. Choose the VPC and subnets (preferably across multiple Availability Zones for high availability).
5. Set the minimum, maximum, and desired number of instances.
6. (Optional) Attach to a Load Balancer.
7. Configure scaling policies (manual, scheduled, or dynamic).
8. Add notifications (SNS), tags, and review settings.
9. Create the group.

## How to Attach & Detach EC2 Instances in ASG

- **Attach**: You can manually attach a running EC2 instance to an ASG if it meets these conditions:
  - It is running.
  - The AMI is available.
  - It is not part of another ASG.
  - It is in the same Availability Zone as the ASG.

- **Detach**: You can detach an instance from an ASG, optionally decrementing the desired capacity. Detached instances can either be terminated or kept running independently.

## Configuring Auto Scaling Policies Based on Load

Auto Scaling policies define when and how the group should scale. Common policy types:
- **Target Tracking**: Keeps a metric (like average CPU utilization) at a target value.
- **Step Scaling**: Scales based on thresholds with step adjustments.
- **Simple Scaling**: Adds/removes a fixed number of instances when a CloudWatch alarm triggers.

**Example (Target Tracking):**
- Metric: Average CPU utilization
- Target: 25%
- When average CPU > 25%, ASG adds instances; when < 25%, removes instances.

## Using Auto Scaling with Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

- Attach your ASG to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Classic Load Balancer.
- All instances in the ASG are automatically registered with the ELB.
- The ELB distributes incoming traffic across healthy instances in the group, ensuring high availability and seamless scaling.

---

## Removing Instances Temporarily

- You can **detach** instances from an ASG temporarily, choosing whether to decrement the desired capacity.
- Alternatively, use the "Standby" state to temporarily remove an instance from service without terminating it. This is useful for maintenance.

---

## Suspend and Resume Process

- ASG processes (like Launch, Terminate, HealthCheck, etc.) can be suspended and resumed.
- Suspending processes is useful during maintenance or troubleshooting to prevent automatic scaling actions.
- Once ready, resume the processes to restore normal scaling activity.

---

## Shut Down – Auto Scaling Process

- If you terminate an instance managed by ASG, the group automatically launches a replacement to maintain the desired capacity.
- To shut down the entire group, set the desired, minimum, and maximum capacity to zero or delete the ASG.

---

## Monitoring – Auto Scaling Instances

- Use the EC2 console or CloudWatch to monitor:
  - Instance status
  - Scaling activities
  - Group health
  - CloudWatch alarms and metrics (CPU, network, etc.)
- The "Activity" tab in the ASG console shows scaling events and instance lifecycle changes.

---

## Health Checks

- ASG performs **EC2 status checks** by default.
- You can enable **ELB health checks** for deeper monitoring, ensuring only healthy, in-service instances receive traffic.
- If an instance is unhealthy, the ASG automatically replaces it to maintain capacity.

---

## Getting Notifications When ASG Changes

- Configure Amazon SNS notifications for ASG events (launch, terminate, fail, etc.).
- In the ASG settings, add a notification and specify the SNS topic and events to monitor.
- You can also use lifecycle hooks to trigger custom actions (e.g., Lambda functions) during instance launch or termination, with notifications sent to SNS.
