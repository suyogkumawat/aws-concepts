# Database Overview

This document provides a brief overview of different types of databases, their common uses, and some popular cloud-based database services with their free tier offerings.

## Types of Databases

While there are many ways to categorize databases, some common types include:

* **Relational Databases:** Organize data into tables with defined schemas, using SQL for querying (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server).
* **NoSQL Databases:** Offer flexible schemas for various data models beyond the relational structure. This category includes:
    * **Key-Value Stores:** Store data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
    * **Document Databases:** Store data as JSON-like documents (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase).
    * **Column-Family Databases:** Store data in column families rather than rows (e.g., Cassandra, HBase).
    * **Graph Databases:** Model relationships between data points as nodes and edges (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).
* **Data Warehouses:** Designed for analytical processing and business intelligence, often involving large datasets (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Snowflake).

## Why Use a Database?

Databases are fundamental for modern applications due to several key benefits:

* **Data Persistence:** Databases provide a reliable and durable way to store data, ensuring it's not lost when an application closes or a server restarts.
* **Data Organization:** They offer structured ways to organize and manage large volumes of data, making it easier to access, update, and analyze.
* **Data Integrity:** Databases often enforce constraints and relationships to maintain the accuracy and consistency of the data.
* **Efficient Retrieval:** They provide efficient mechanisms for querying and retrieving specific data based on defined criteria.
* **Concurrency Control:** Databases manage simultaneous access by multiple users or applications, preventing data corruption.
* **Scalability:** Many database systems are designed to scale horizontally or vertically to handle increasing data volumes and user traffic.
